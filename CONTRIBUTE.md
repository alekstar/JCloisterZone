# Contributing to [JCloisterZone](http://jcloisterzone.com/)



## I found a bug. How to report it?

Sorry for that. The preferred way is to [look through the existing issues](https://github.com/farin/JCloisterZone/issues) on the project's GitHub pages. If the bug has not already been reported you can create a new issue. Alternatively send an email. Attaching a saved game and `error.log` (if created) may be helpful.



## In which ways can I contribute?

I am glad for any help â€” suggestions, localizations, design or programming contributions, beta testing or donations are welcomed. Just get in touch!



## I'm a programmer, can I change and improve the code?

Yes, the help would be much appreciated!
